Here are the reasons why I chose to study DevOps: 

- Why I decided to study DevOps? 
    - I have been working in Software Engineering and Development fields for slightly over 3 years and over that timeframe I got to get a hands on experience on many software development practices, however, I never had time to study how to implement DevOps at work. The only thing I knew is that it is a hot topic, and DevOps skills are in high demand right now. When I saw this course, I decided to combine it along with the Cloud and Software Systems course to get a complete understanding of DevOps practices. 


- What I enjoyed about the course:
    - Getting hands on experience with GitHub actions, Hugo setup, automatic project deployment. At first I was publishing the site to gh-pages branch manually, but after I saw how fast it can be done with the deploy workflow setup, DevOps got +1 fan.  

- What I learned on this course: 
    - I became familiar with building static websites with Hugo
    - I became a god of Git commands
    - I am now familiar with the topics of DevOps, CI/CD, pipelines, automation of deployment
    - I am now familiar with YAML and TOML syntax
    - I learned about GitHub actions and how to integrate workflows into them 


- What I disliked about the course:
    - The course materials were a bit messy, and utilizing Hugo themes was a painful experience as not every theme is well documented and not every theme has a standard folder structure, however, after a properly working theme was found, the rest of the project was completed in a matter of a few hours.
