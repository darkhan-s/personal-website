My name is Saidnassimov Darkhan and I am a second year Master's student in Automation and Electrical Engineering at Aalto University. Currently I am employed as a Software Developer at Redrakon and previously was employed as a Software Engineer at Raute Oyj, which is where my interest towards Computer Science and the DevOps course, in particular, comes from. To hear more about why I chose to study DevOps, click the "Why DevOps" at the navigation panel.
